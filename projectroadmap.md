1. >**DONE**  Propose a project idea relating to our current major and interests with the intent of project approval so we can start on our project. 
2. >**DONE**  Research code templates which have a similar objective as our project idea in order to attain framework for the code.
3. >**DONE**  Utilize textbook resources to attain addition knowledge of how to build the code.
4. >**DONE**  Create the framework of the code in our Github repository in order to have a functioning keylogger at a basic level. 
5. >**DONE**  Record the functioning and non-functioning components of the code so that it is apparent which functions/features need to be edited or added to the code in order for the code to be complete. We need to observe whether all the desired features can be implemented into the code successfully. If they can't be successfully implemented, we will have to decide whether to delete the feature all together and whether to add a new feature in its place.
6. >**DONE**  Add an in-depth explanation of the application's purpose into the readme page in the repository so that viewers can have a clear idea of the code's goal.
7. >**DONE**  Create a projectroadmap.md file in the keylogger repository so that the steps of the project, progress of the project, and project team member roles are outlined.
8. Write the code which outputs all the key logs into a saved .txt file so that all of the keystrokes that the application records are then saved into a file that can be later viewed. 
9. Add the necessary imports into the code which will then allow the code to successfully record the key logs into the .txt file.
10. Revise the code if needed, but make sure that it overall successfully runs and that the project objective has been met.
11. Ensure that the .txt file is being saved in the correct place that is stated in the code. In this case, it is will be in a folder labeled "temo" under the local disk C:
12. Test the code by using various applications on your computer such as Powershell and Google Chrome to monitor if the code successfully records the application being used in addition to the user's key strokes. 
13. Upload the final code to our project repository in Github. 
14. Create a powerpoint slide to represent our project and what it does for Sprint 3. 
15. Review any necessary steps for presentation and plan accordingly. This task will need to broken down into multiple tasks once the presentation instructions are released.
