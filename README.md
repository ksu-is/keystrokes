Keystrokes

This script displays user keystrokes in a terminal.

Note:
  - This code only works on Windows systems
  - It is important to note that additional libraries are needed to run this code which is not covered in class such as:
  	- pyHook
	- pythoncom

Not working:
  - Ctrl + C is not working so the program cannot quit by itself
  - Output in .txt format is not working
  - There are some exceptions being generated but no major bugs.
